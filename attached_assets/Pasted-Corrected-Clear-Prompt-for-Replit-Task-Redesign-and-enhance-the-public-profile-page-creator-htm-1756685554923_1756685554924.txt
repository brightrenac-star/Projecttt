Corrected & Clear Prompt for Replit

Task:
Redesign and enhance the public profile page (creator.html) with the following improvements:

Profile Section (Modern Layout)

Replace the old design with a grid-style layout:

A banner image at the top (spanning full width).

A circular profile picture centered, overlapping the banner.

The profile owner (creator) can update the banner and profile picture at any time.

Creator Info Area (under the profile grid)

Show display name and @username.

Show a short description/bio (set by the creator in their profile settings).

Show social platform icons (e.g., Instagram, YouTube, X/Twitter, Twitch).

Icons only appear if the creator has added those links in their profile page.

Clicking an icon opens the external link.

Inline Post Composer (Owner only, on public profile)

At the top of the feed, show a small collapsed bar that says “Share something…” with an attach icon.

When clicked, the bar expands into a posting tool directly on the same page (no page navigation).

Posting tool must include:

Text box (for post content, like Facebook).

Attach file button with an icon (only images/videos allowed).

Visibility options: Public, Subscribers Only, Pay to Unlock.

If “Pay to Unlock” is selected → show a price input field.

Post button (disabled until there is text or media, and a valid price if Pay to Unlock).

Posts Feed

Show posts in reverse chronological order.

Each post card must include:

Creator’s avatar + display name

Post content (text + media)

Timestamp

Edited badge if the post has been updated (editedAt exists)

Like/Upvote button (toggle state, similar to “like” on social apps)

Comment section below each post:

Comment input box (modern/futuristic style, works well on desktop & mobile)

List of comments with avatar, username, text, timestamp

Upvote/Downvote for comments

Post owner can delete or hide any comment

Post action menu (top-right, owner only): options to Edit, Delete, or Hide the post

Visual Design

Each section (profile, post feed, comments) should have a slightly different background color/surface, so users can clearly distinguish between them (e.g., light-blue gradient for header/profile, lighter surface for posts, another shade for comments/chat).

The comment box should have a futuristic style (glass/gradient look, rounded corners, soft shadows) and adapt well to both desktop and mobile.

Ensure proper horizontal and vertical spacing (use padding/margins so boxes, text, and sections never overlap).

Buttons and inputs must have enough size (≥44px height) for mobile tap targets.
