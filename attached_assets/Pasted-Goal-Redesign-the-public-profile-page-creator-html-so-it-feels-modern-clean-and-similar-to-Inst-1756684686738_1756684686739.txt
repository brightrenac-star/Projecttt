Goal

Redesign the public profile page (creator.html) so it feels modern, clean, and similar to Instagram/Facebook, with inline posting for creators, social links, and interaction tools.

Profile Section (Top of Public Page)

Banner area:

Full-width banner image across the top.

Banner is slightly collapsed behind the profile picture for a layered effect.

Profile picture:

Circular avatar displayed in the center, overlapping the banner.

Owner editing:

If the logged-in user is the owner of this profile and has role CREATOR, show an “Edit Profile” button to update banner, profile picture, bio, and social links.

Owner can change these anytime (via PATCH /users/me).

Creator Info (Below Banner/Profile Picture)

Display name & @username

Short description / bio (editable by owner)

Social media icons row (only show icons if creator has added links in profile.html):

Instagram, YouTube, X (Twitter), Twitch, etc.

Each icon is clickable → opens external platform link.

Inline Post Composer (Owner Only, at Top of Feed)

“Share something…” text placeholder + small attach icon.

On click: expands in place (no page change) to a posting tool.

Fields:

Large text box for writing content (like Facebook).

Attach file button with icon (accept only images/videos).

Visibility selector: Public, Subscribers Only, Pay to Unlock.

If Pay to Unlock selected → show a price input field.
