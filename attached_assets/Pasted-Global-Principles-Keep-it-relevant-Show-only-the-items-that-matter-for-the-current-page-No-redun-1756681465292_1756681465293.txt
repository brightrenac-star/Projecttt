Global Principles

Keep it relevant: Show only the items that matter for the current page.

No redundant links: If you’re already on a public profile, hide the “view public profile” icon/button.

Auth-aware: Header content changes based on loggedIn and role (CREATOR/SUPPORTER).

SUI theme: Use a light-blue gradient accent for header/footer (subtle), not the whole page.

Shared Header Structure (one DOM, toggled by JS)

Left: Logo/Home (always)

Mid: Contextual tabs (varies by page)

Right:

Logged out: Login, Register

Logged in: Search, Messages, Avatar menu (Profile, Studio for creators, Logout)

Shared Footer (multi-row, concise)

Row 1 (contextual short links): e.g., page help, reporting, status (optional)

Row 2 (legal): Terms, Privacy

Row 3 (meta): © Suiciety, Language switch (optional)

Footer must stay short. If no page-specific links, show only Row 2 + Row 3.

Per-Page Header / Footer Rules
1) Public Creator Page (creator.html?id=...)

Header

Show: Logo/Home, Discover, (if logged in) Messages, Search

If viewer is NOT the owner: show Support and Message buttons in the page header section (not the global header bar)

Show compact post bar at top of the feed (click to expand the posting tool in place)

Hide any “View Public Profile” button (redundant)

Show “Edit Profile” and “Studio” buttons in the page header section

Row 1: “Report this page” (mailto or route), “Creator guidelines”

Row 2–3: Terms, Privacy, ©

Inline Posting (Public Profile — Owner View)

At the top of the feed, show a small compact bar: “Share an update…” + attach icon.

On click, expand inline to a posting tool (still on the same page) with:

Text area

Attach media (images/videos only)

Visibility select: Public / Subscribers / Pay to Unlock (show price input only when Pay to Unlock)

Post button (disabled until text or media present; price > 0 in Pay mode)

Use FormData for upload; do not set Content-Type manually.

Visibility & Redundancy:

Only show the compact bar + composer if viewer.id === creator.userId.

Do not show a “public profile” button while you’re already on the public profile.

Acceptance Criteria

Header/footers follow the per-page rules above.

No redundant items (e.g., no “public profile” button when already there).

Public creator page (owner view) shows compact bar → expands composer inline.

Composer supports media only (accept="image/*,video/*"), previews, visibility switch, pay price.

On successful post: composer resets; feed refreshes.

On failure: user sees meaningful error text from the server.
